# ManagedEntity

### Utility that supports entity management in JPA

#### Features:
- get EntityManager and Session objects from JPA via unified API
- support secondary DB keys (a.k.a. business keys) while also using Ids as primary keys ([see also: JPA - The uniqueness dilemma and solution](http://lifeinacubicleblog.com/2016/10/09/jpa-the-uniqueness-dilemma-solution/))
- paginate DB entries based on custom criteria

API documentation available at https://thisismydesign.github.io/managed-entity/javadoc/

#### Feedback

Any feedback is much appreciated.

I can only tailor this project to fit use-cases I know about - which are usually my own ones. If you find that this might be the right direction to solve your problem too but you find that it's suboptimal or lacks features don't hesitate to contact me.

Please let me know if you make use of this project so that I can prioritize further efforts.
